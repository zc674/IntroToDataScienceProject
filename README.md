Final Project Hiphop Music Analysis 
The aim of the project is to identify the elements that make up a popular hip-hop song. More specifically, by looking at the lyrics, performing sentiment analysis, and other analytical modelling, we would like to know if a given song would become a hit on the Billboard charts. 
Wwe used several models including Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Sentiment analysis and topic modelling were as well applied. We also explored the mechanism behind the models we tested in order to explain the accuracy level observed.
